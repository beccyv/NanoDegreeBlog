              Once the poor relation of the holiday world and loved only by
              those of retirement age, cruising has undergone a massive image
              transformation in recent years. Newer cruise lines such as Virgin
              Cruises have finally managed to rehabilitate the reputation of a
              holiday on the seas - and the idea of seeing the world, whilst
              packing once, has really taken hold.
            </p>
            <p>
              These days, there's a cruise for everyone. Whether you are a
              family with children seeking the thrills and spills of the slides,
              skating and movies on Royal Caribbean or a bright young thing who
              loves to party on one of the new adult only ships, there's a
              cruise you'll love.
            </p>

              Child friendly cruises have pools and more aimed specifically at
              children
            </figcaption>
            <p>Emma Godwin, a young mother in her thirties, describes her realisation that cruising might suit her family:
              <blockquote>
                "To be honest, I thought cruising was just for the elderly, but then a few of my friends who are parents started taking Disney 
                cruises and it just progressed from there. When you have children it's just such an easy way to travel. 
                Having said that, my niece in her twenties goees on party cruises now too, so I guess it's not just for families either."
              </blockquote>

            <h2>How to find the right cruise for you?</h2>
            <p>
              When it comes to picking the right cruise, the most important
              thing is to work out what you want from a holiday. If yours is a
              child focused getaway pick one of the family friendly cruise
              lines. With ships filled with bowling alleys, death defying slides
              and even ice rinks, there really isn't much you can't do aboard a
              family friendly cruise ship - for a price. If you prefer something
              a little more about the nightlife and a little less about the
              little people, be sure to find one of the cruise lines that is
              adults only and focuses on evening entertainment and get ready to
              party the night away.
            </p>
            <p>
              By contrast, if you prefer a holiday that's a little more sedate,
              look out for cruise lines that operate at a somewhat slower pace.
              If you don't like throngs of people and non stop entertainment,
              but would rather while away the days with a book, there are cruise
              lines that focus on the food and ambiance and offer a gentle
              wander around the high seas.
            </p>

            />
            <figcaption>
              There are many cruise options for those that prefer a slower, more
              relaxing style of cruising
            </figcaption>
            <p>
              As with every holiday experience it's best to go armed with
              knowledge when you book. We suggest reading
              <a href="https://www.cruisecritic.co.uk/" target="_blank"
                >Cruise Critic</a
              >
              reviews to learn more about any ship or line you are considering
              booking. Best of all, talk to friends who have cruised and enjoy
              the same types of holidays as you do. Youtube has a wealth of
              information about cruising and walkthroughs of every ship so you
              can see what you are getitng before you book.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, a <em>great</em> travel agent can also be invaluable.
              There's nothing better than someone who knows the world of
              cruising and can help you book the trip of your dreams.
